# MEOW, MEOW, MEOW, MEOW

`MEOW` stands for the MIRI search for Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs.  It is a JWST Cycle 3 program led by Mary Anne Limbach.

``MEOW`` is a general-purpose tool that subtracts the sky background from dithered MIRI images that contain only point sources.
This tool should be run on ``jwst`` Stage 2 data products, followed by the provided wrapper for ``jwst`` Stage 3.
The only file that needs to be modified and then executed is ``run_meow.py``.
